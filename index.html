            <p>As someone who has recently switched from an iPhone over to an android, it is very interesting
                to see some of the changes that apple is making. Thew new cameras on the devices have gotten
                to a point where they render some professional dslr cameras irrelevant. It is also nice that 
                the new devices come equipped with 120hz screens as my iPhone 13 Pro Max only has 60hz.

                <time>December 2nd, 2022.</time>

            </div>

            <p>I think that EU is on the right track by implementing the use of cell phones on plane rides,
                and although this may come as a big convenience to most. I can see the negatives that might
                follow along with this. For example, the person sitting beside you talking on their phone
                for an entire plane ride might be very bothersome. It will be interesting to see how planes
                companies will handle these concerns.

                <time>December 9th, 2022.</time>

            </div>

            <p> It is always interesting when such a massive company like Microsoft tries to make a 
                purchase like this. Being such a big fan of the companies, Blizzard, Active Vision and
                Microsoft, I wonder what would happen moving forward with certain games already being locked
                to certain devices.

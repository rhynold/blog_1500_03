            <p>As someone who has recently switched from an iPhone over to an android, it is very interesting
                to see some of the changes that apple is making. Thew new cameras on the devices have gotten
                to a point where they render some professional dslr cameras irrelevant. It is also nice that 
                the new devices come equipped with 120hz screens as my iPhone 13 Pro Max only has 60hz.
